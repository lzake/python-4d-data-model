The city is more than capable of renovating a field.   \n Hence, the \"informed decision\" made 10 years ago was whether to sell prime time rights to a private school in exchange for the cost of renovation, or about $2M.  \n\nWhether it was a reasonable deal then, it seems much less so now.  The new decision before the city is whether the contract should be extended another 9 years in exchange for about $700k in renovations.  The extension would give away rights for a similar period of time (9 v. 10 years) for a much, much lower value for the public ($2M v. $700K).  In the interim, experience strongly suggests that public use rights outside of \"prime time\" are significantly less valuable than the city originally thought, a key point made in the article.  Oh, also, DC's budget is in much better shape -- and it isn't clear the $700K in renovations are even necessary at this juncture for the park to be usable by the public.\n\nIf there is any discretion in the agreement over whether to extend, declining to extend seems like an absolute no-brainer."}, {"20190830": "It is nice that you think that, but their marketing team isn\u2019t how the hype started.
